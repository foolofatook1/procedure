    <h>&there4;CI&there4;</h>
    <p>This is a game that revolves around Kant’s Categorical Imperative (CI). Specifically, the classic model, or hypothetical imperative, involving thirst. Kant uses the experience of thirst to explain the categorical imperative: “If I wish to quench my thirst, I must drink something”. This is an “imperative” based on its being a proposition declaring necessary action. To Kant the use of “necessary action” and the use of the “golden rule” (treat others as you would like to be treated) are the basis of his moral philosophy, and his means of reasoning through the obstacles or choices presented to him throughout life.
In the game, you play as the “Thirsty Man”. You are either thirsty, or not. The game will tell you whether or not you are thirsty, but you may drink as much as you like for an undecided interval of time. When this time is up, “Dying Man” will appear (or not). You may offer him water (or not). It is totally up to you. The win condition of this game, is to respond to the choices following the Categorical Imperative.
